## Slide 2: The Problem We Solve (1 minute)

### 🚨 Critical Statistics
- **92% of people abandon their goals** within the first year
- **70% of New Year's resolutions fail** by February
- **Lack of accountability** is the #1 reason for goal failure

### 🎯 Specific Problems Addressed

**1. Vague Goal Setting**
- People set unclear goals like "get fit" or "learn coding"
- No structured methodology for goal definition
- **Our Solution:** Force SMART goal framework implementation

**2. Progress Invisibility** 
- Small daily progress feels insignificant
- No systematic way to track and visualize improvement
- **Our Solution:** Real-time progress logging with historical data

**3. Accountability Gap**
- Goals remain private, making quitting easy
- No external pressure or support system
- **Our Solution:** Built-in accountability partner with automated notifications

**4. Motivation Decay**
- Initial enthusiasm fades without reinforcement
- No celebration of milestones or achievements
- **Our Solution:** Automated achievement notifications and progress sharing

## Slide 4: Backend Architecture & API Design (2 minutes)

### 🛠️ Backend Technology Stack
- **Node.js** with ES6 modules for modern JavaScript
- **Express.js** for RESTful API framework
- **SQLite** for lightweight, embedded database
- **Nodemailer** for automated email notifications

### 🗄️ Database Schema Design

**Activities Table (Goals Storage):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE activities (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,                    -- Goal title
  specific TEXT NOT NULL,                -- S.M.A.R.T. criteria
  measurable TEXT NOT NULL,
  achievable TEXT,
  relevant TEXT,
  timebound TEXT NOT NULL,
  buddy_email TEXT,                      -- Accountability partner
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Logs Table (Progress Tracking):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE logs (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  activity_id INTEGER NOT NULL,         -- Foreign key relationship
  text TEXT NOT NULL,                    -- Progress description
  metrics TEXT,                          -- Optional JSON data
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (activity_id) REFERENCES activities (id)
);
```

### 🔌 RESTful API Endpoints

**Activities Management:**
```javascript
GET    /api/activities           // Retrieve all goals
POST   /api/activities           // Create new goal
PUT    /api/activities/:id       // Update existing goal
DELETE /api/activities/:id       // Remove goal
PATCH  /api/activities/:id/complete  // Mark as completed
```

**Progress Logging:**
```javascript
GET    /api/logs?activity_id=:id     // Get logs for specific goal
POST   /api/logs                     // Create progress entry
GET    /api/logs/activity/:id/stats  // Analytics and statistics
```

**Accountability Notifications:**
```javascript
POST   /api/notifications/achievement     // Send progress update
POST   /api/notifications/goal-completed  // Celebrate completion
POST   /api/notifications/weekly-summary  // Regular check-ins
```

### 🔒 Backend Architecture Features

**1. Database Layer Abstraction**
```javascript
class Database {
  async get(sql, params)    // Single record retrieval
  async all(sql, params)    // Multiple records
  async run(sql, params)    // Insert/Update/Delete
}
```

**2. Email Notification System**
- HTML-formatted progress updates
- Automated accountability partner engagement
- Configurable email templates
- Error handling for network issues

**3. Error Handling & Validation**
