Project: Progress Buddy

A simple web app to log measurable activities, visualize progress, set goals, and keep an accountability partner in the loop.

Core Concepts

Activities: categories you track (e.g., “Workout”, “LeetCode”).

Logs: time-stamped entries with metrics (e.g., sets/reps/weight; problems_solved).

Goals: target progress for a period (e.g., “50 LeetCode problems in August”, “10 workouts this month”).

Partner: one buddy gets notified about your achievements, streaks, and goal hits.
